## Accessing someone else’s profile

- When you see a listing of other clinicians, whether it be through the search feature on the upper right of the website, on the list of connections, or on a profile, simply click on the user’s icon to be moved to their profile. This will allow you to refer, connect, view their information, among other features.

## Editing your profile

- Navigate to your own profile (see Accessing your profile above).
- Hit the “Edit” button in the upper right corner of your profile.
- Your profile will now have text boxes for each section. You may add, delete, or edit the information in each field.
